What are the changes in your life because of college?

New Role:
-	Well, I have to be independent, I have to do things on my own now, there’s no more “kasambahay” to help me fix my bed, clean my room, and give me food everyday. And this time, I don’t get to do everything I want to do. 
New Routine: 
-	I used to wake up at 6am. Now, I NEED to wake up at 5am. You never know if there’s a traffic waiting for you. No more watching T.V and playing games at 12mn with cousins. It’s hard but I’m fine with it. 

New Relationship:
-	I have some new college friends and new B.mates, they’re super fun to be with. BUT! H.S friends are still.. Irreplaceable.

New Assumption:
-	I’m assuming that after all this hard work, I’ll have an awesome job in the future and be successful. 
